# Seven Minute Tabs

Based heavily on the [Tabs with Automatic Activation example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html) from [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel)

## Features

* Code converted to be a web component.

* Adds `hidden` attribute in JavaScript so that content still shows when JavaScript is not available.
* Adds `tabindex` in JavaScript to avoid accessibility problems without JavaScript.
* Arrow key support. Adjusts for vertical `aria-orientation` values.
* Home/end key support.
* (Option to delete tabs was removed from the original example)
